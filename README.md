# DESCRIPTION

A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. For more information on it, you can check this out ```https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher```.
